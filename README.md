DotModus Fake Data Generator for GAE, Cloud Storage and Big Query
=================================================================

###Python Library Management
We have used [gaenv](http://blog.altlimit.com/2013/06/google-app-engine-virtualenv-tool-that.html)
to install and configure 3rd party Python Libraries not natively available on the
GAE platform.

For now, the only one used is [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)

###Cloud SQL Setup
The public IP address for the DB instance is 173.194.249.47

You can connect using the root user and the Modus password (this is not the
  password... just a reminder)

The database create script is in the SQL folder and is called kyc.sql
